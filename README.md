[Think-in-Memory: Recalling and Post-thinking Enable LLMs with Long-Term Memory]()
- Authors: Lei Liu, Xiaoyan Yang, Yue Shen, Binbin Hu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinjie Gu, Guannan Zhang(Ant Group)
- TL.DR: The TiM (Think-in-Memory) mechanism enhances LLMs for long-term interactions by introducing a novel memory system that stores and updates historical thoughts, avoiding the common problem of biased or inconsistent reasoning with repeated recall. TiM works by recalling relevant past thoughts before response generation and updating memory with new insights after, using principles like insert, forget, and merge for dynamic memory management. Additionally, it incorporates Locality-Sensitive Hashing for efficient long-term conversation retrieval. Tests on real and simulated dialogues show that TiM significantly improves LLMs' response quality in prolonged interactions.

[LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12307)
- Author: Yukang Chen(CUHK), Shengju Qian(CUHK), Haotian Tang(MiT), Xin Lai(CUHK), Zhijian Liu(CUHK), Song Han(MIT, NVIDIA), Jiaya Jia(CUHK)  
- TL.DR: LongLoRA is a novel fine-tuning method designed to efficiently extend the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) without significantly increasing computational costs. It introduces two main improvements: the shifted sparse attention (S2-Attn) mechanism for efficient fine-tuning with sparse local attention, saving computation during the context extension process, and an optimized version of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) that focuses on trainable embeddings and normalization for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This approach allows for extending the context size of models like Llama2 from standard lengths to up to 100,000 tokens with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating strong performance on various tasks. LongLoRA maintains the original architecture of the models and is compatible with existing techniques, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle longer contexts effectively.

[PoSE: Efficient Context Window Extension of LLMs via Positional Skip-wise Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10400) [Code](https://github.com/google-deepmind/randomized_positional_encodings)
- Author: Dawei Zhu(Peking University & Microsoft Corporation), Nan Yang(Microsoft Corporation), Liang Wang(Microsoft Corporation), Yifan Song(Peking University), Wenhao Wu(Peking University), Furu Wei(Microsoft Corporation), Sujian Li(Peking University)
- TL.DR: The paper introduces Positional Skip-wisE (PoSE) training, a novel method for extending the context length of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for intensive Full-length fine-tuning. PoSE cleverly simulates longer inputs within a fixed context window by dividing it into chunks and applying distinct skipping bias terms to manipulate each chunk's position indices. This technique allows the model to adapt to any position within the target length efficiently, significantly reducing memory and time costs. The authors successfully extended the LLaMA model to handle 128k tokens using only a 2k training context window and demonstrated PoSE's compatibility with RoPE-based LLMs and position interpolation strategies. This method opens the possibility of scaling LLMs to potentially infinite lengths, bounded only by inference memory constraints.

[Focused Transformer: Contrastive Training for Context Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03170)
- Author: Szymon Tworkowski(IDEAS NCBR, University of Warsaw), Konrad Staniszewski(IDEAS NCBR, University of Warsaw), Mikołaj Pacek(IDEAS NCBR, University of Warsaw), Yuhuai Wu(xAI), Henryk Michalewski(University of Warsaw, Google DeepMind) Piotr Miło´s(IDEAS NCBR, Institute of Mathematics, Polish Academy of Sciences, deepsense.ai)
- TL.DR: The Focused Transformer (FoT) addresses the challenge of large language models losing efficiency as external memory scales, by refining the structure of the memory's (key, value) pairs through a contrastive learning-inspired training process. This technique allows for extending the effective context length of models without succumbing to the distraction of irrelevant information. By applying this method to fine-tune existing large-scale models, such as 3B and 7B OpenLLaMA, the enhanced versions, named LongLLaMA, show improved performance on tasks requiring extensive context, managing up to a 256k context length effectively for information retrieval.

[Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Positional Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595)
- Author: Shouyuan Chen, Sherman Wong, Liangjian Chen, Yuandong Tian(Meta)
- TL.DR: We present Position Interpolation (PI) that extends the context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained LLMs such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning (within 1000 steps), while demonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks that require long context, including passkey retrieval, language modeling, and long document summarization from LLaMA 7B to 65B. Meanwhile, the extended model by Position Interpolation preserve quality relatively well on tasks within its original context window. To achieve this goal, Position Interpolation linearly down-scales the input position indices to match the original context window size, rather than extrapolating beyond the trained context length which may lead to catastrophically high attention scores that completely ruin the self-attention mechanism. Our theoretical study shows that the upper bound of interpolation is at least ∼600× smaller than that of extrapolation, further demonstrating its stability. Models extended via Position Interpolation retain its original architecture and can reuse most pre-existing optimization and infrastructure.

[Randomized Positional Encodings Boost Length Generalization of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16843) [Code](https://github.com/google-deepmind/randomized_positional_encodings)
- Author: Anian Ruoss, Grégoire Delétang, Tim Genewein, Jordi Grau-Moya, Róbert Csordás, Mehdi Bennani, Shane Legg, Joel Veness (DeepMind. The Swiss AI Lab, IDSIA, USI & SUPSI.)
- TL.DR: This work identifies the failure of Transformers to generalize to sequences of arbitrary length as a problem rooted in positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences. To address this, the authors introduce a novel randomized positional encoding scheme designed to simulate longer sequence positions, allowing the model to generalize to unseen sequence lengths more effectively. Their extensive evaluation across 6000 models and 15 tasks shows a significant improvement in generalization capabilities, with an average increase of 12.0% in test accuracy for sequences longer than those seen during training.

[Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16300)
- Author: Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi(EPFL)
- TL.DR: The paper introduces a new method to handle longer contexts in Transformers without sacrificing the random-access flexibility of their attention mechanism. By using "landmark tokens" to represent input blocks, the method enables efficient selection of relevant context directly through the attention mechanism, avoiding the need for separate retrieval systems. This approach allows processing of much longer contexts seamlessly, improving performance and extending context length capacity significantly (e.g., up to 32k tokens for LLaMA 7B), making it competitive with state-of-the-art models like Transformer-XL and GPT-4 but with fewer resources.

[Exploring Length Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04901) 
- Author: Cem Anil, Yuhuai Wu, Anders Andreassen, Aitor Lewkowycz, Vedant Misra, Vinay Ramasesh, Ambrose Slone, Guy Gur-Ari, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur (Google )
- TL.DR: This paper explores the ability of transformer-based language models to generalize from short to longer problem instances in reasoning tasks, an important aspect of out-of-distribution generalization. Through empirical studies, the authors find that simply fine-tuning transformers on tasks requiring length generalization leads to significant deficiencies, regardless of the model's size. However, they discover that leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of pretrained large language models, combined with scratchpad prompting (which involves asking the model to outline solution steps before providing the final answer), significantly enhances length generalization capabilities. The study also conducts failure analyses to identify common mistake patterns, suggesting pathways for future improvements in enabling language models to handle longer and more complex problem instances effectively.

[Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409)
- Author: Ofir Press(University of Washington, Facebook AI Research), Noah A. Smith(University of Washington, Allen Institute for AI), Mike Lewis(Facebook AI Research)
- TL.DR: ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) introduces a novel and efficient approach for enabling transformer models to handle longer sequence extrapolation than seen during training, without adding positional embeddings to word embeddings. Instead, ALiBi biases attention scores based on the distance between tokens, allowing a model trained on sequences of length 1024 to effectively manage sequences up to 2048. This method not only trains faster and uses less memory compared to traditional sinusoidal position embeddings but also outperforms other position methods on benchmarks like WikiText-103 due to its inductive bias towards more recent information.

[RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864)
- Author: Jianlin Su, Yu Lu, Shengfeng Pan, Ahmed Murtadha, Bo Wen, Yunfeng Liu(Zhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.)
- TL.DR: The paper explores different methods of incorporating positional information into transformer-based models and introduces a new technique called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE uniquely combines rotation matrices to encode absolute positions with the ability to capture explicit relative position dependencies within the self-attention mechanism. This approach offers advantages like adaptability to various sequence lengths, diminishing dependency between tokens as their relative distance increases, and enhancing linear self-attention models with relative positioning capabilities. The improved transformer model, dubbed RoFormer, is tested across several long text classification benchmarks, showing superior performance compared to existing methods. The paper also provides theoretical insights to explain these experimental findings.
